									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>
										The picture above describes my life right now. I wake up and drink coffee 
										to get myself prepared for the work that needs to be done. I find programming 
										enjoyable, I like challenges, and learning is a constant must for me.
										I find it interesting the different environment that I find myself in throughout 
										these courses and assignments. Each lab or assignment is unique and brings new 
										inqueries each time.
									</p>
									<p>
										I spent most of my life either on a gaming console or on a computer. 
										I found myself practicing computer programming because I was always surrounded 
										with computer programs my entire life. I thought that it would probably be 
										beneficial if I learned how to use computers to my advantage and I can 
										support that statement now. I feel like a lot of auotmation can be made with 
										computer as information is incredibly prevalent to this day.
										Sometimes I find myself programming even outside of College. I can use 
										applications I create however I want and find joy in the process.

									<h2>Interests</h2>
									
									<p>
										I also played sports throughout my life. I tried Soccer, Basketball, 
										Badminton, Volleyball, and many more. Now, I enjoy a new and upcoming 
										sport called Pickleball that is popular in the US. People hate on it 
										because its basically a copy of Tennis, but I find it more fun and 
										I think people should usually do what they enjoy if it does not 
										come at the expense of other people.
									</p>

									<p>
										At this point in my life, I have the most understanding of strategy 
										mechanics of every sports and know what it takes to win. 
										I am a firm believer in consistency, within evreything that you 
										do in life, and it is so important to implement in it your daily life.
										Consistency in computer programming means sacrificing most of your time 
										reading documentation, providing implmentation of new features to 
										applications, and being patient with developing your skill as a 
										developer. This is exactly what I strive to be and what I am working 
										towards constantly. For some reason Pickleball really was my 
										stepping stone for realizing this because many Pickleball videos 
										said that the high level players have consistency and low level 
										players do not. 
									</p>

									<h2>Skills</h2>
									<p>
										My main skills include problem solving and teamwork. I constantly 
										put myself through situations that test my problem solving skills 
										and prioritize teamwork in collaborative settings. I am confident 
										in my competence when it comes to technical skills while covering 
										the important areas of soft skills. I am also a very competitive 
										individual and strive to be the best I can be through practice, 
										effort, and increased knowledge.
